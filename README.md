we are building a customer support chatbot for a retail company that sells products online. The goal of the chatbot is to assist customers in multiple ways, including answering product-related queries, tracking orders, handling refunds, and providing general information about store policies.

Each customer query can have multiple intents, such as requesting information about a product and also asking about its availability. The chatbot should be able to classify these queries into one or more intents simultaneously. For example, the query "What are the features of the latest phone, and can I return it?" has two intents: one related to product information and the other related to returns.

Objective: Create a model that can classify a given customer query into one or more intents from the following categories:

Product Inquiry - Queries related to product details (e.g., features, pricing, availability).

Order Tracking - Queries related to tracking orders (e.g., "Where is my order?").

Refund Request - Queries related to requesting a refund (e.g., "How do I return this product?").

Store Policy - Queries related to the storeâ€™s policies (e.g., return policies, delivery times).

The model should be able to classify one or more intents for each query.
